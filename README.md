## Introduction
[The Super AI Engineer 2021: Handwritten Digit competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/super-ai-engineer-2021-handwritten-digit/overview) requires particpant to predict 1-5 digits from the images pool captured by participants themselves. We applied various technique and ultimately select [TrOCR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.10282) to be used in this notebook. 

Unfortunately, the competition dataset is not available publicly. **To fully use the notebook, you have to be competition's participant and change Google Drive path in the notebook to your own images storage path.**

## Outcome
- **Ranked #3 amongs 50 teams** participating the [Kaggle hackathon](https://www.kaggle.com/c/super-ai-engineer-2021-handwritten-digit/leaderboard) in the score leaderboard.
- Scored (Edit distance) 0.31059 and 0.30506 in private and public leaderboard
